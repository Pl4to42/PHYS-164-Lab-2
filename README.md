## To-Do / Key Steps
- [x] Week 1
  - [x] Learn to operate the USB 2000 spectrometer
  - [x] Observe and compare spectra of common sources - incandescent lamp, fluorescent strip light, and gas discharge lamps
  - [x] Save spectra and read them into in Python for plotting and analysis
- [x] Week 2
  - [x] Write a centroid algorithm
  - [x] Find the wavelength solution of the spectrometer
    - [x] write linear least-squares algorithm
    - [x] Error propagation to linear least-squares (lab manual page 6) EVERETT
      - Note: not in key-steps and lab manual is never explicit in saying we need to, but the scientific writing guide says to never present a number without its associated error, so this is probably necessary
- [ ] Week 3
  - [ ] Reduce spectral science frames from the KAST spectrograph (lab manual page 9) BRIGETTE/TIFFANY
    - Note: we probably only need to do this for 2 fits files
    - [ ] bias/dark subtraction
    - [ ] flat field correction
  - [ ] Extract 1-dimentional spectrum of *at least* two astronomical sources and compare and contrast these spectra BRIGETTE/TIFFANY
  - [ ] Apply a rough wavelength solution to the KAST spectrograph and illustrate the spectra with units of wavelength BHAVYA
    - Note: we will need to find the solution fit to the KAST spectrograph specifically, so this requires using some KAST data to identify peaks and make a new fitting function, a repeat of the steps in week 2
